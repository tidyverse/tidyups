# Tidyup 2: tidyr \<-> stringr alignment

**Champion**: Hadley Wickham  
**Co-champion**: Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel  
**Status**: Draft

## Abstract

```{r setup}
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

## Motivation

stringr and tidyr provide surprisingly different interfaces for string manipulation.
This means that they need to be taught almost completely separately, and what you learn from stringr has little ability to improve your use of tidyr.

-   stringr was designed before I understood how important data frames were, so multi-column results use matrices.
    This makes them hard to immediately use in other tidyverse packages.
    No stringr function returns a data frame, which is particularly painful given that `summarise()` and `mutate()` can now use data frame results to add multiple columns.

-   To overcome this challenge, tidyr provides some functions that make it easy to split up characters into multiple variables.
    Unforunately, the tidyr and stringr function names are not well aligned:

    -   `extract()` is similar to `str_match()`
    -   `separate()` with regex is similar to `str_split_fixed()`
    -   `separate()` with numeric columns has no equivalent in stringr.
    -   `separate_rows()` is equivalent to `str_split()`

-   tidyr string functions use base R regular expressions; stringr uses stringi.
    There are relatively few difference between PCRE and ICU regular expression engines, but you need to use a very different syntax for (e.g.) ignoring case.
    There's some need to keep tidyr dependencies lightweight (and stringr can be a challenge in some environments), it would be nice to use it if available.
    (Following in the footsteps of 003-dplyr-radix-ordering).

-   Combining separation by pattern and separation by position in `tidyr::separate()` now seems excessively clever; it's hard to discover how to separate by position.

-   Neither stringr nor tidyr provide a particularly nice way to work with named capture groups.
    There's also scope for more directly matching column names to patterns if `extract()` didn't attempt to match the syntax of `separate()` so closely, e.g. `str_extract(x, c(type = ".*", "|", fruit = "orange|apple"))`.

<!-- -->

-   tidyr only provides one function for splitting a string across rows, rather than columns: `separate_rows()`. Why does this exist and not `extract_rows()`? Why is there no way to split by string length? Are we missing a general dplyr pattern for this situation?

## Solutions

There are five ways you might want to split up a string:

-   Into a fixed number of pieces by length/position, e.g. `"1m15"` -> `c(trt = "1", gender = "m", age = "15")`

-   Into a varying number of pieces by length, e.g. `"abcdef"` -> `c("ab", "cd", "ef")`

-   Into a fixed number of pieces by a pattern, e.g. `"a/b/c"` -> `c("a", "b", "c")`

-   Into a varying number of pieces by a pattern, e.g. `"a/b/c"` -> `c(treatment = "a", group = "b", subgroup = "c")`

-   Into named groups, e.g. `"a(b)c"` -> `c(treatment = "a", group = "b", subgroup = "c")`

Generally, when the pieces might vary from entry to entry you'll want to create rows; when the pieces are fixed, you'll want to create columns.
If you have a compound problem like `"a-b-c/d-e-f/g-h-i"` you can solve it by first splitting into rows and then into columns.

| By      |         | stringr         | tidyr             |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Length  | Fixed   |                 | `separate()`      |
| Length  | Varying |                 |                   |
| Pattern | Fixed   | `str_split_n()` | `separate()`      |
| Pattern | Varying | `str_split()`   | `separate_rows()` |
| Group   | Fixed   | `str_match()`   | `extract()`       |

(Can't cleanly decouple this into stringr + dplyr functions, because there's no way to create multiple rows in dplyr; that appears to be fundamentally a tidyr operation.)

But that can't handle changes to number of rows.

-   `stringr::str_separate_by()` -> `tidyr::separate_by_wider()`, `tidyr::separate_by_longer()`.
    That doesn't work because the lower-level function needs to be different too

-   `stringr::str_separate_at()` -> `tidyr::separate_at_wider()`, `tidyr::separate_at_longer()`

-   `stringr::str_extract()` -> `tidyr::extract_wider()`, `tidyr::extract_longer()`

How to handle when number of entries doesn't match number of columns.

### Conditional stringr dependency

Use stringr regexps if stringr is installed, or pattern wrapped with `stringr::regexp()` or friends.
If stringr not installed, message that using base R; provide `perl()` or similar to suppress that message if you deliberately want to use PCRE.
