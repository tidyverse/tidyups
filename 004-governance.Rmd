# Tidyup 4: governance model

**Champion**: Hadley Wickham  
**Co-champion**: Tracy Teal  
**Status**: Proposa

## Abstract

Our open source packages currently don't have a well defined governance model.
We do have a basic set of assumptions under which we operate, but we have not previously made them precise.
This tidyup lays out a model that strikes a balance between the benevolent dictator and rough consensus models, and defines the relationships between four key roles: a large community of package **users,** a smaller pool of GitHub **contributors**, a team of **authors**, and a single **maintainer**.

## Motivation

We currently have one package (ggplot2) with a [formal governance model](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), and an informal, undocumented model that we've used for other packages (e.g. dtplyr, dbplyr).
The goal of this tidyup is to come up with holistic, flexible model, that can become our default governance model going forward.
This is part of a general movement to get better at defining and documenting our processes to so that there's a clear path from package user to package developer.

## Solution

The following sections describes a governance model to use as a default for open source RStudio repositories (starting with those in the r-lib, tidyverse, and tidymodels organisations).
It is not mandatory, but it has been designed to reflect our current best practices, and should be used unless there are compelling reasons to favour a different approach.

The model strikes a balance between the [benevolent dictator](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel) and [rough consensus](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282) governance models.
We blend these two governance models because we want to involve the community in decision making as much as possible, while recognising that excellent user experience requires consistent design guided by a single voice.

### Users

People who use the package are the most important members of the community; without these users, this project would have no purpose.
Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible.
Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

-   Evangelising about the project.
-   Asking and answering questions on community forums.
-   Providing moral support (a "thank you" goes a long way).

### Contributors

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved.
Such users may then go on to become **contributors** by interacting with the project on GitHub.
Contributors:

-   Report bugs and suggest improvements by creating new issues.

-   Improving existing issues by answering questions, creating reprexes, or providing feedback on proposed changes.

-   Contributing code or documentation via pull requests.

Anyone can become a contributor: there is no expectation of commitment to the project, no required set of skills, and no selection process.
The only requirement is to follow the code of conduct.

Packages don't maintain an explicit list of contributors but acknowledge them in blog posts using data from GitHub aggregated by `usethis::use_tidy_thanks()`.

### Authors

Contributors who have made significant and sustained contributions can be invited to become authors.
Authors are collectively responsible for day-to-day development of the package, including responding to issues and reviewing pull requests.
An author possesses two special powers:

-   They have **write** access on GitHub so they can triage issues, request review on PRs, and merge them.

-   They are listed in `Authors@R` so they receive credit when others cite the package.

Authors are expected to follow our standard processes, such as:

-   **Code contribution**: code is usually contributed via PR, even for authors who could push directly.
    Particularly high-stakes project may want to protect the main branch and require "request reviews before merging".

-   **Communication**: authors are involved in most of the interactions with contributors and thus need to set a welcoming and inclusive tone for the project.

-   **PR review**: all pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other author.
    In general, there is no expectation that PRs contain clean commit histories, but it's appreciated where possible.

-   **Backward compatibility**: any backward incompatible changes (i.e. changes that cause reverse dependencies to fail `R CMD check` or are likely to cause problems in user code) must be approved by the maintainer.
    Significant backward incompatible changes need to be accompanied with a plan for how they will be communicated to the community.

-   **CRAN releases**: package releases are made on an as-needed basis, and increment either the major, minor, or patch version depending on the scope of the release.
    The process itself is defined by `usethis::use_release_issue()`.

-   **Decision making:** when a package has multiple authors, where possible decisions are made using rough consensus amongst the authors.
    If consensus is hard to reach or taking too long, the maintainer will make a decision.

(We expect to flesh these processes out in the coming months.)

Authors are recruited from contributors.
An invitation to join the authors can be extended to anyone who has made significant and sustained contributions, and has acted in accordance with the code of conduct.
Any existing author can propose a contributor be invited by emailing the maintainer.

### Maintainer

A maintainer is the author with primary responsibility for the project.
As well as the responsibilities of an author, they also:

-   Set and clearly communicates the strategic objectives of the project.
-   Oversee CRAN releases.
-   On-board new authors.
-   Mediate conflicts amongst authors.
-   Enforce the code of conduct.
-   Recruit their replacement if they want to retire from the project.

A maintainer has two special powers:

-   They have **admin** access on Github, allowing them to add new authors when needed.

-   They are listed in `Authors@R`, along with their email address and the "cre" (creator) role (a maintainer often isn't the creator, but CRAN mandates the use of this role).

Maintainer turnover is slow and we have not yet developed a process for it, but we'd generally expect a maintainer to be a long-standing author.

The maintainers of most of RStudio's open source repositories are RStudio employees.
This is not a requirement but a recognition of the tension between making development open to all and ensuring that users can trust that a package will be maintained in the long term (i.e. 10+ years), which typically requires the maintainer be explicitly remunerated for their work.
Where the maintainer is not an employee of RStudio, we ask for the "right of first refusal" â€” if the maintainer wants to stop maintaining the package (for whatever reason) they first offer it back to RStudio.
In the future, we hope to find other ways of financial supporting maintainers apart from full-time employment.

### Common tasks

#### Author invitation

To on-board a new author, the maintainer looks for rough consensus amongst authors (which would include no objections within 7 days).
The maintainer then sends the following email:

> Hi {name},
>
> In recognition of your significant contributions to {package}, would you be interested in becoming a co-author of the package?
> This means that you'll be acknowledged in `Authors@R` and given write permission on GitHub.
> Write permission gives you the power to change {package} directly (which is fine for smaller fixes) but I'd appreciate it if you'd continue to send major stuff through the pull request process.
>
> If you accept, can you please prepare a PR that:
>
> -   Adds your info to `Authors@R`
> -   Tweaks `_pkgdown.yml` if you want to link somewhere from the pkgdown site
> -   Advertises the change in NEWS.md
> -   Re-builds the documentation to get updated package docs
>
> I'll then add you as admin, and approve the PR, then you can squash-merge it.
> This would be our workflow going forward.
> (You'll also be able to request reviews from me and other authors as needed).
>
> Thanks for all your work on {package}!
>
> {your_name}

(After this tidyup is approved, the template will become a usethis function.)

## Open issues

-   How can we communicate with authors? Do we add them to a team? Do we add them as members of the repo? Do we add them to a slack channel?
-   Are there other common tasks?
-   What steps do we need to take to align existing repos with the new policy?
