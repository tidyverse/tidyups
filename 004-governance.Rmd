# Tidyup 4: governance model

**Champion**: Hadley Wickham\
**Status**: Proposal

## Abstract

## Motivation

## Solution

This document describes a default governance model to use for all open source RStudio repositories (starting with r-lib, tidyverse, and tidymodels).
It is not mandatory, but it has been designed to reflect our current practices, and should be used unless there are strong reasons to favour a different model for an individual repo.

This is heavily adapted version of the [Benevolent dictator governance model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel) by Ross Gardler and Gabriel Hanganu licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

### Roles

There are four key roles: a large community of **users,** a smaller community of **contributors**, a team of **authors**, and a **maintainer**.
All roles are bound by the code of conduct.

#### Users

People who use the package are the most important members of the community; without these users, this project would have no purpose.
Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible as user contributions help ensure that the project is useful.

Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

-   Evangelising about the project.
-   Asking and answering questions on community forums.
-   Providing moral support (a 'thank you' goes a long way).

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved.
Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described below.

#### Contributors

Contributors interact with the project on GitHub by filing new issues, improving existing issues, or submitting pull requests.
Anyone can become a contributor: there is no expectation of commitment to the project, no required set of skills, and no selection process.

Contributors are not individually listed in the package source, but are acknowledged in blog posts, via `usethis::use_tidy_thanks()` which consults the GitHub API.

Contributors who have made significant and sustained contributions (either through code or otherwise) can be invited to become authors.

#### Authors

Authors are collectively responsible for day-to-day development of the package, including responding to issues and reviewing pull requests.
An author is identified in two ways:

-   They have write access on GitHub, which means that they can triage issues, request review on PRs, and merge them.

-   They are listed in Authors\@R, which means that receive credit when others cite the package.

While authors can modify code directly, this ability is should be used as rarely as possible.
Instead, we prefer a workflow where changes are proposed as pull requests, and are only merged after they have been reviewed by at least one other author[^1].
Changes to the API (especially breaking changes) must also be approved by the maintainer.

[^1]: There are some exceptions to this rule, particularly for very new packages (where API iteration is much faster) and packages with only one author.

Authors are recruited from contributors.
An invitation to join the authors can be extended to anyone who has made significant and sustained contributions.
Any existing author can propose a contributor be invited team by emailing the maintainer.
The project lead will the confirm the invitation with the other authors before extending the invite.

#### Maintainer

The maintainer:

-   Setting and clearly communication the strategic objectives of the project.
-   Over-seeing CRAN releases (possibly by asking an author to lead the release).
-   Mediating any conflicts amongst the authors.
-   Enforcing the code of conduct.
-   Ensuring that the project survives in the long term by finding a new maintainer when they are ready to move on.

The maintainer is identified by the "cre" (creator) role in Authors\@R.

For the many of our open source repositories, the maintainer is member of one of the RStudio open source teams.
There is a tension between making development open to all and ensuring that packages are maintained in the long term (i.e. 10+ years).
Where the maintainer is not an employee of RStudio, we ask for the "right of first refusal" --- if the maintainer wants to stop maintaining the package (for whatever reason) they first offer it back to RStudio.

### Decision-making process

This project makes decisions according to a consensus model where suggestions are considered and discussed between the community and core developers, typically in GitHub issues.
Where consensus cannot be reached, the project lead's word is final.
If the community questions a decision, the project lead may review it and either uphold or reverse it.

### Author invitation template

(Probably should eventually become a usethis function)

> Hi {name},
>
> In recognition of your significant contributions to {package}, would you be interested in becoming a co-author of the package?
> This means that you'll be acknowledged in [Authors\@R](mailto:Authors@R){.email} and given write permission on GitHub.
> Write permission gives you the power to change dbplyr directly (which is fine for smaller fixes) but I'd appreciate it if you'd continue to send major stuff through the pull request process.
>
> If you accept, can you please prepare a PR that:
>
> -   Adds your info to `Authors@R`
> -   Tweaks `_pkgdown.yml` if you want to link somewhere from the pkgdown site
> -   Advertises the change in NEWS.md
> -   Re-builds the documentation to get updated package docs
>
> I'll then add you as admin, and approve the PR, then you can squash-merge it.
> This would be our workflow going forward.
> (You'll also be able to request reviews from me and \> other authors as needed).
>
> Thanks for all your work on {package}!
>
> {your_name}
