# tidyups

This repo is a work-in-progress exploration of a process for formalising bigger changes to the tidyverse. It is used by the tidyverse team to propose and discuss changes that have significant cross-package scope. The process itself is still very much a work in progress, but you can read the current outline in [001-tidyup-process.md](001-tidyup-process.md)
