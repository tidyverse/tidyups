# Tidyup 9: R project requirements

**Champion**: Thomas

**Co-Champion**: Hadley

**Status**: Draft

## Abstract

Historically, R has had a single way of describing the requirements of a project: the `DESCRIPTION` file. This is a text file in the dcf format which is used to describe metadata for an R package, including any dependencies the package may have. While this file format could also be used to describe non-package R project, it has a number of deficiencies that makes it reasonable to consider a new format altogether. These includes:

-   Insufficient syntax for dependency version requirements
-   Depends/Imports/Suggests/Enhances does not align well with the dependency levels needed for projects in general
-   No way to specify the source of the package, fallbacks if not accessible, etc

It would be possible to add to the syntax and spec of the DESCRIPTION file but we would then end up with two divergent specifications with resulting confusion.

In parallel with this, there have been efforts to create ways of capturing the exact environment of a project for the sake of reproduction. The current state of the art for this is renv, which encodes the state in an renv.lock file. However, a lock file is orthogonal to describing requirements as it fixes all dependencies to a specific version making graceful upgrades of dependencies difficult.

This document intends to sketch out a new file specification for describing *requirements* of R projects. The goal is to support:

-   Rich version constraints of dependencies
-   Global and per-package repositories for dependencies
-   Meaningful levels of dependencies, including:
    -   Testing
    -   Development
    -   Platform
-   R and system requirements
-   General project metadata

Further, from the spec it should be possible to derive renv lockfile and a DESCRIPTION file (but not the other way since our spec will be richer). The spec should be able to exist in a separate file as well as inlined in a script file as a header.

Initial support for the spec should include:

-   pak, for deriving and installing dependencies according to the requirements
-   rig, for setting up the correct R version, as well as installing dependencies. Should probably also be able to derive an renv.lock file
-   Connect and Connect Cloud should accept this as an alternative to manifest.json

## Relevant use cases

The following use cases are interesting to consider, because they bring out nuance in working with a project requirements specification:

1. Local development of project. The user may have more flexibility in terms of R version and package versions available to use. Commonly, the default choice will be to use the latest version of R and the latest versions of packages available on CRAN. This presents the least constraints on dependency resolution.

2. Production deployment of project. In ideal cases, development and production environments will closely match, however it is not uncommon that the user may have more constraints on R version and package versions available to use, and the the operating system and related system dependencies may differ. Dependency resolution may falter when translating local development environments to production environments, so it is critical that only the true constraints are captured in the project requirements. 

3. Reproducing an old project. The user may want to reproduce or revive an old project. This may require using an older version of R and older versions of packages, which may no longer be available on CRAN. Operating system and related system dependencies may also differ. In this case, it is important that the project requirements capture all constraints necessary to reproduce the project, while still allowing for flexibility in resolving dependencies that are no longer available. Additionally, all new projects will eventually become old projects. The specification should have a means for maturing or evolving the project requirements without imposing unnecessary rigidity.



## Prior art

Project requirements are not a problem unique to R and many programming languages have different ways of solving it. We want to highlight just a few:

### pyproject.toml in uv (Python)

TBD

### cargo.toml

TBD

### rproject.toml in rv (R)

TBD

### The project table

This table contains metadata about the specific project. None of these fields are relevant to how the project should be executed or how the environment it should be executed in looks like. The specific elements of the table are as follows:

| Element | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| name | The name of the project as a single string with no spaces |
| version | The current version of the project |
| description | 1-3 sentences describing the project |
| authors | An array of inline tables giving name, email, and role of the authors of the project |
| license | The license this project is distributed under |
| readme | A pointer to the file that serves as this projects readme document |
| homepage | The url of this projects homepage |
| repository | The location of the repository for this project |
| keywords | An array of keywords describing the project |

### The r table

This table describe the R environment that the project should be executed in. Specifically the version constraints on the R runtime, but also additional settings in R

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| version | The version of R to use for executing the project. See the version syntax in the description of the \[dependencies\] table |
| options | A subtable holding any R `options()` that should be applied to the session before executing the project |
| env | A subtable holding environment variables that should be set in the R session prior to executing the project |

### The repositories table array

repositories is an array of repository configurations which define the various locations the dependencies can come from. Each entry into the array must be conform to the following spec

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name | The name of the repository. Will be used when referencing the repository in dependencies |
| url | The url pointing to the repository. The repository must conform to CRAN guidelines for R repositories |
| priority | An integer. Repositories will be tried in descending order so the repository with the highest priority will come first |
| auth | A subtable giving optional authentication settings for the repository. The subtable must include a `type` element defining how authentication must be done, along with any additional elements relevant to the type |

### The dependencies table {#dependencies}

This table gives hard R package dependencies for the project which will be required for any mode of execution (see [The additional-dependencies table]). Dependencies are given as named entries to the table with the name giving the name of the dependency. The value can be either a single string giving the version constraint of the dependency or a subtable with more specific information of the nature of the dependency

#### Version Specification Reference

| Format | Meaning | Example |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `"x.y.z"` or `"^x.y.z"` | Compatible updates | `"1.2.3"`/`"^1.2.3"` → `>= 1.2.3, < 2.0.0` |
| `"=x.y.z"` | Exact version | `"=1.2.3"` |
| `">= x.y.z"` | Greater than or equal | `">=1.2.3"` |
| `"< x.y.z"` | Less than | `"<2.0.0"` |
| `"~x.y.z"` | Patch updates only | `"~1.2.0"` → `>=1.2.0, <1.3.0` |
| `"range1, range2"` | Multiple constraints | `">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"` |

#### Subtable syntax

When providing the dependency as a subtable it can follow one of several schemas:

##### Version and repository

If you want to specify the exact repository to retrieve the dependency from use a subtable with the following schema

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| version | The version requirement of the package as described above |
| repository | The name of the repository to retrieve it from, referencing a repository given in the repositories array |

##### Git package

If you want to use a dependency from a git repository use a subtable with the following schema

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| git | A url pointing to the package in the given repository. The terminal `.git` part of the url is optional |
| branch | Which branch to get. If omitted the default branch will be used (unless rev or tag is set) |
| tag | A specific git tag to use |
| rev | Any identifier not branch or tag. Often a commit hash, but some repositories also allow you to reference pull requests etc. |

##### Package from url

If the dependency is located outside of git but accessible as a build tarball online you can use the following subtable

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| url | The url pointing to the package |
| hash | A checksum for the package given as a combination of algorithm and hash, separated by `:`. |

##### Local package

A local package can be stated as a dependency with this subtable

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| path | A path pointing to either the source directory of the dependency or a build tarball. The path can either be absolute or relative to the rproj.toml file |

### The additional-dependencies table

The dependencies table gives strong dependencies for the project under any mode of use. However, there may be dependencies that are only relevant for certain scopes of use. These can be given as subtables to the additional-dependencies table. The schema of the subtables matches that of the dependencies table. While you are free to define new types of additional dependencies, a set of predefined types are provided and should be used if they match the need:

-   `additiona-dependencies.test` provides dependencies only relevant during testing of the package

-   `additiona-dependencies.dev` provides dependencies only relevant during development of the package

-   `additiona-dependencies.doc` provides dependencies only relevant when rendering the documentation of the package

-   `additiona-dependencies.platform.<OS>` provides dependencies only relevant when running on the given OS

### The system-dependencies table

The dependencies and additional-dependencies table only concern themselves with R package dependencies. There may be system library requirements as well which can be stated under the system-dependencies table. This table contain named entries with the name giving the system library and the value giving either the version constraint or a subtable with additional information about the dependency. The version string is subject to the same syntax as given [Version Specification Reference]. If providing a subtable it must follow the given schema

| Element | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| version | The version requirement of the system library as described above |
| optional | A boolean indicating if the requirement is hard (defaults to true) |
| libname | A subtable giving the exact name of the library for specific distributions if it cannot be resolved automatically. |
| needed-for | An array of strings referencing the subtables in the additional-dependencies table. If provided it will only be required in those modes. If missing the library will be installed for all modes. |

### The config table

This table allows you to set specific runtime settings for your project. Schema TBD

## renv.lock Integration

Rather than defining a new lockfile format, this proposal leverages the existing `renv.lock` format. The current `renv.lock` format is already well-established in the R ecosystem and provides:

-   Exact versions of all direct and transitive dependencies
-   Source information (repository URLs)
-   Package hashes for verification
-   Platform awareness

Tools implementing this standard would:

1.  Read dependency intent from `rproj.toml`

2.  Resolve dependencies according to specified constraints

3.  Write exact resolution results to `renv.lock`

4.  Use `renv.lock` for reproducible installations

## Open questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `[dependencies.test]` syntax adds a subtable to the `dependencies` table. This means that it may conflict with other entries in the `dependencies` table, e.g. if someone where to create a package called `"test"` and your project depended on that then you couldn't define any test dependencies because this is not allowed:

``` toml
[dependencies]
test = "0.3.0"

[dependencies.test]
testthat = "0.1.0"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The subtables of `[entrypoints]` e.g. `[entrypoints.shiny]` seems to add package specific behavior to the spec which seems like a bad way to go down. Alternatively we define the `[entrypoints]` fields in the same way as the `[repositories]` fields and provide a spec for the elements. Still, I'm not sure what kind of functionality we are looking to gain from this

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `rmarkdown = { version = "^2.20", features = ["pandoc"] }` line seems unspecified. What does the `features` field denote?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is unclear what the purpose of the `[scripts]` table is. Is it purely for documentation, in which case this information should probably live in the script file so it travels around with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should rig or some other cli tool be able to setup *and* execute a script without the user ever opening up R. Kind of analogous to `cargo run`?

## Motivating examples

### The Matrix Package Problem

#### What Happened
In April 2024, the Matrix package (a core R package used by ~50% of CRAN) released version 1.7-0 requiring R >= 4.4. CRAN then removed the older version (1.6-5) from its package index, leaving users on R 4.2/4.3 unable to install Matrix or any package depending on it (like lme4, mgcv, ggplot2, etc.).

#### The renv Lock File Problem
Looking at an `renv.lock` from before 4.4, you have:
* R version: 4.3.3
* Matrix: pinned to exactly 1.6-5
* Dependency chain: ggplot2 → mgcv → Matrix

And looking at an `renv.lock` from after 4.4, you have:
* R version: 4.4.0
* Matrix: pinned to exactly 1.7-0
* Dependency chain: ggplot2 → mgcv → Matrix

**The issue** renv locks every package to an exact version. We can't use the first lockfile with R 4.4 and up, and we can't use the second one with anything before 4.4. This is even though neither ggplot2 nor mgcv actually care which Matrix version they get, they just need some compatible version.

#### Current Workarounds (All Painful)
1. Use an old snapshot of a repository → But then all packages are old, missing updates to unrelated packages
2. Upgrade to R 4.4 everywhere → Often not possible in enterprise environments
3. Manage two versions of lock files → Not scalable, error-prone, tedious

#### One Dependency File, Multiple R Versions
Here's the real power of flexible dependencies: the same project could work on both R 4.3 and R 4.4+ without any changes. Consider a flexible dependency file that just says:

```
[dependencies]
ggplot2 = ">=3.1.0"
# Matrix is transitive—don't pin it
```

#### On R 4.3.3:
* Resolver finds Matrix 1.6-5 (compatible with R >= 3.5)
* Installs ggplot2, mgcv, Matrix 1.6-5
* Everything works ✓

####  On R 4.4.0:
* Resolver finds Matrix 1.7-0 (compatible with R >= 4.4)
* Installs ggplot2, mgcv, Matrix 1.7-0
* Everything works ✓

**Why this works** The actual functions that mgcv uses from Matrix didn't change between 1.6-5 and 1.7-0. The API is stable. Similarly, ggplot2's usage of mgcv is unchanged. The R version requirement bump in Matrix was about internal/compilation changes, not about breaking the interface that downstream packages rely on. With exact version pins (current renv approach), you'd need separate lock files for R 4.3 vs R 4.4. With flexible dependencies, one file works everywhere—the resolver picks the right Matrix version for each environment automatically.

Most transitive dependencies don't need exact versions—they just need compatibility. Lock files are too rigid: one package's version bump (Matrix requiring R 4.4) breaks the entire dependency tree, forcing you to freeze everything to an old date. Flexible dependency specifications (like npm, pip, cargo use) would let the solver find compatible combinations at install time, avoiding "snapshot hell" where you sacrifice updates to hundreds of packages just because one transitive dependency has a version conflict. And critically, they allow the same project to be portable across R versions without maintaining separate lock files.
